    "**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This initial step involves cleaning the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing date formats. NLP-specific preprocessing will also be necessary, such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.\n",

    "**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Employing statistical and visualization techniques to summarize the dataset's main characteristics. This includes analyzing the distribution of emails over time, the most frequent senders and recipients, and the length of emails.\n",

    "**TF-IDF:** Using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF or count vectorization generate a list of the five TF-IDF terms that best describe the emails. This can provide insights into the main topics and themes discussed in the emails.\n",

    "**Temporal Analysis:** Investigate how email communications change over time, identify any patterns or anomalies in the volume of emails sent and received, and correlate these with external events or timelines.\n"
